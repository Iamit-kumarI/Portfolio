🚀 Amit Kumar – Developer Portfolio

A data-driven developer portfolio built with React, Spring Boot, and MongoDB, designed to showcase real coding activity, backend skills, and production-ready architecture.

This portfolio goes beyond static content by fetching and visualizing competitive programming data (LeetCode, CodeChef, AtCoder) using graphs and heatmaps.

🧠 Project Vision

Most portfolios only claim skills.
This project proves consistency and growth using real coding data and backend-driven analytics.

Goal:

Create a modern, scalable, and backend-heavy portfolio suitable for campus placements and interviews.
